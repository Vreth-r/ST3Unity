# Super Tic Tac Toe

Small personal project. ST3 (Super Tic Tac Toe) is 2 dimensional Tic Tac Toe. I heard you like Tic Tac Toe, so I put Tic Tac Toe in your Tic Tac Toe!

This specific version is built on Unity and is developed as a mobile app! Please see the original Java version on my github page if you're interested.

## How to Play:
Each space in a normal T3 board is replaced with another T3 board, making the ST3 board. Players must "play" their marker (X or O) on the ST3 board by winning the T3 game in that space.

When you place a marker in a T3 board, your opponent must play in the corresponding larger space in the ST3 board. For example, if I play in the top left position of a T3 board, my opponent must play in the top left position of the ST3 board. Your opponent can play in any position they want in that board.

If the board you are supposed to play in is already completed, whether a tie, win, or loss, you can play in any space in any T3 game.

This continues until the ST3 board is won.

The game will highlight playable spaces and fade out non playable spaces. It will also tell you whose turn it is.
## Lessons Learned

I need to learn Unreal 5.


## Install

Download and install the lastest release APK. Ignore all warnings. Go ahead and scan for malware but I pinky promise there's none in there.

Aspect ratio may not render correctly on all devices. This is intended for a normal 9:16 portrait view phone screen.
